## what is climatry

Climatery is an ongoing research project focused on revolutionizing disaster prediction. It aims to integrate real-time satellite data with advanced data analytics and machine learning to forecast multi-hazard disasters on a global scale. Traditional models often face challenges in merging global data streams and predicting complex climate phenomena, but Climatery seeks to address these limitations.

This innovative system continuously collects and analyzes satellite data from around the world, creating a comprehensive framework that monitors various climate factors, such as precipitation, wind patterns, soil density, and vegetation coverage. By examining these interrelated environmental conditions, Climatery can predict cascading disasters, such as drought-induced wildfires followed by landslides from heavy rains.

The project is actively evolving as researchers work to refine its capabilities. Current efforts are focused on enhancing data integration, expanding the range of disaster types monitored, and improving the systemâ€™s ability to deliver actionable insights for disaster prevention and resource management.
